    "\n",
    "Possible reasons for missing values:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `name`: Data entry or extraction errors during dataset compilation.\n",
    "- `genre`: Incomplete metadata or classification issues in the original source.\n",
    "- `year_of_release`: Missing historical records or incomplete archival data.\n",
    "- `critic_score`: Some games may not have received professional reviews.\n",
    "- `user_score`: Games with insufficient user ratings or pending evaluations (\"TBD\").\n",
    "- `rating`: ESRB classification may be absent for older titles, games released outside North America, or due to incomplete records.\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing values in `critic_score`, `user_score`, and `rating` were preserved, since imputing them could introduce bias into correlation analysis, regional comparisons, and hypothesis testing.\n",
    "\n",
